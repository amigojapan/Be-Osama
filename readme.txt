Be Osama
A game by Usmar Padow
Warning: This game is intended as a joke. I don't endorse terrorism
and don't intend to offend Americans or Islamic people.

In this game you are Osama Bin Laden

Your goal is to terrorize the entire world.

-You start off with 10000 Moneys
-You can train a recruiter for 1000
-You can send a recruiter to any continent, your chances of him getting caught
on his way are inversly proportional to the number of anti-terrorist forces in that continent.
-Each recruiter can train from 1 to 5 terrorists per turn.
-Each terrorist gets you 100 moneys per turn.
-Each turn, you can be attacked by a terrorist sting operation that can cost you terrorists and recruiters, the chance of this happening grows if there are many anti-terrorist forces.
continents with many anti terrorist forces are dangerous for you.
-To see the ammount of weapons you have, hover the mouse over Osama Bin Laden's picture
-To attack, you will need a weapon and a certain ammount of terrorists to pull off the
operation. This is displayed when you hover the mouse over a type of attack.
-When you launch an attack, the ammount of anti-terrorists grows arround the world due to panic
 about terroritsts.
-Wether an attack is successful or not, you will loose some terrorists in the
process.
-To kill anti-terrorist forces, do millitia attacks.
-Depending on the strenth of your attacks, the terror level will go up, if it reaches 100% world wide, you win.
-If the world terror level reaches a sertain ammount, there will be a war on terror, which will decrease your forces arround the world. but, if you
terrorize the world enough over a sertain threshold, the world won't be
able to continue its war on terror.
-The terror level decreases by a certain ammount each turn

Stratergy:
Send recruiters to a continent with few anti-terrorit forces, let them recruit alot of
terrorists and collect money from them, don't attack until you have a large force of
terrorists and alot of money. Use millitia attacks to reduce the ammount ot anti terrorist forces
in continents that have many, then infiltrate them. Instead of small trrorists attacks once
in a while, opt fot striking once with strong terrotist attacks

If you want to, you can click the play music button. I didn't enable music by default for
several reasons.

License:
I allow you to modify or distribute this game as long as you keep my name somewhere visible so I can take credit. also, you must distribute the source code
with it.
What is left to do in the development of the game:

Bug, the ammount of Nukes and Anthrax appear as 00 and 10  instead of 0 and 1
Bug, (esily fixable) the continent changes after clicking on an item to buy
Difficulty level adjustability
Testing to see if Game Over comes up when world terror level reaches 100% (someone please tell me if it does)
Adding War on terror when threshhold is meat.
